# Conway's Game of Life
This is a fun project that implements the classic Conway's Game of Life simulation, which kind of simulates cellular life over time.

Each highlighted block represents a single cell and a group of nearby cells from a pattern. There are a lot of interesting patterns, like oscillators, spaceships, guns and more that could be tested out in this program.

Although the Game of Life usually takes a starting configuration and simulates while the colony is alive, this implementation allows the modification of the colony at any time by pausing the simulation to allow for more fun experimentation.
